// Instructions consist of an operation and a list of operands.  Operations
// are specified by name.  We will document the supported operations and their
// semantics in the API.  The number and types of operands are specified by a
// descriptor string, and the operands themselves are specified as a variable
// argument list following the descriptor string.  The order of the operands in
// the argument list matches the characters in the descriptor string.  The
// currently supported characters are
//
// 'c': The operand is a condition for instructions such as conditional
//      branches and conditional selects.  The value of the operand is passed
//      using type const char *.  Supported condition names will be documented
//      in the API.  'c' may be placed at an arbitrary position in the list of
//      operands.
//
// 'B': The operand is a broadcast specifier for a vector instruction.
//      Supported broadcasts include "1to16", "1to8", "4to16", "4to8", and
//      "none".  If no broadcast is specified for an instruction that supports
//      a broadcast, the default is "none".  'B' may be placed at an arbitrary
//      position in the list of operands.
//
// 'U': The operand is an up conversion specifier for a vector instruction.
//      Supported up conversions include "float16", "srgb8", "uint8", "sint8",
//      "unorm8", "snorm8", "uint16", "sint16", "unorm16", "snorm16", "uint8i",
//      "sint8i", "uint16i", "sint16i", "unorm10A", "unorm10B", "unorm10C",
//      "unorm2D", "float11A", "float11B", "float10C", and "none".  If no
//      up conversion is specified for an instruction that supports an up
//      conversion, the default is "none".  'U' may be placed at an arbitrary
//      position in the list of operands.
//
// 'D': The operand is a down conversion specifier for a vector instruction.
//      Supported down conversions include "float16", "float16rz", "uint8",
//      "sint8", "unorm8", "snorm8", "uint16", "sint16", "unorm16", "snorm16",
//      "uint8i", "sint8i", "uint16i", "sint16i", and "none".  If no down
//      conversion is specified on an instruction that supports a down
//      conversion, the default is "none".  'D' may be placed at an arbitrary
//      position in the list of operands.
//
// 'Z': The operand is a swizzle specifier for a vector instruction.  Supported
//      swizzles include "cdab", "badc", "aaaa", "bbbb", "cccc", "dddd",
//      "dacb", and "none".  ("none" is equivalent to "dcba".)  If no swizzle
//      is specified for an instruction that supports a swizzle, the default is
//      "none".  'Z' may be placed at an arbitrary position in the list of
//      operands.
//
// 'z': There is no operand.  This is only applicable to write-masked vector
//      instructions on AVX512 platforms, and indicates the instruction should
//      use zero masking.  'z' may be placed at an arbitrary position in the
//      descriptor string.
//
// 'R': The operand is an explicit rounding mode specifier for instructions
//      that support an explicit rounding mode.  Supported rounding mode
//      specifiers include "rn" (round to nearest), "rd" (round toward negative
//      infinity), "ru" (round toward positive infinity), "rz" (round toward
//      zero), and "none" (hardware default rounding mode, usually taken from a
//      control register).  If no rounding mode is specified for an instruction
//      that supports an explicit rounding mode, the default is "none".  'R'
//      may be placed at an arbitrary position in the list of operands.
//
// 'S': There is no operand.  Indicates the Suppress All Exceptions (SAE)
//      feature should be enabled on the instruction.  'S' may be placed
//      at an arbitrary position in the descriptor string.
//
// 'H': The operand is a memory hint specifier for a load/store instruction
//      that supports such a hint.  Supported memory hints include "nt", "eh",
//      and "none".  If no hint is specified for an instruction that supports a
//      memory hint, the default value is none.  'H' may be placed at an
//      arbitrary position in the list of operands.
//
// 'i': The operand is a 32-bit integer.  The value of the operand is passed
//      using type int32_t.
//
// 'j': The operand is a 64-bit integer.  The value of the operand is passed
//      using type int64_t.
//
// 'r': The operand is a reference to another instruction.  The value of the
//      operand is passed using type CGInst.
//
// 'M': The operand is a memory reference.  The value of the operand is passed
//      using type CGAddr.
//
// 'm': DEPRECATED!  The operand is a memory reference.  The value of the
//      operand is passed using three arguments: a CGAddr to specify the
//      address, a uint32_t to specify the size, and a void* to specify the
//      handle.  The handle is an opaque type that is passed back to the client
//      in the memory disambiguation callback routine,
//      CGGetProbabilityOfOverlapFromClient.  This operand type is deprecated.
//      Use 'M' instead.
//
// 'v': DEPRECATED!  The same as 'm' except that the memory reference is
//      considered volatile.  This operand type is deprecated.  Use 'M'
//      instead.
//
// 'd': DEPRECATED!  The operand is a pure address.  The value of the operand
//      is passed as a CGAddr.  'd' operands differ from 'm' operands in that
//      they do not actually dereference the address, so the size and handle
//      are not applicable.  'd' operands are used in instructions such as lea.
//      This operand type is deprecated.  Use 'M' instead.
//
// 'n': The operand is a symbol.  The value of the symbol is currently passed
//      using type const char *, but this needs to change.  We need a more
//      generic concept of a symbol.  (The current implementation was a hack
//      to get hello, world working.)
//
// 'l': The operand is a list of instruction references.  The value of the
//      operand is passed using an of type CGInst, terminated by CGInstInvalid.
//
// 'b': The operand is a label, typically used for branch instructions.  The
//      value of the operand is passed using type CGLabel.
//
// 'a': This descriptor indicates that the instruction being created is not
//      really a new instruction but rather a sub-definition of an existing
//      instruction.  The operand specifies this existing "root" instruction
//      using type CGInst.
//
// 'I': The operand is a const char * that specifies the name of the intrinsic
//      function.  This operand type is only allowed when creating a call
//      instruction.
//
// 'P': The operand consists of two const char * arguments that define an
//      attribute=value pair for an intrinsic math function.  The attribute
//      name is the first argument, and the value name is the second.  This
//      operand type is only valid when creating an intrinsic function.  Legal
//      strings for the attribute and value names are as follows:
//
//          accuracy-bits-32
//          accuracy-bits-64
//              These attributes specify the required number of accurate bits
//              in the mantissa of the result for single and double precision,
//              respectively.  The value is specified as a double.
//
//          max-error
//              This attribute is an alternative way to specify the required
//              accuracy for an intrinsic math function.  The value is
//              specified as a double and gives the required accuracy in ulps
//              (units in the last place).  Only one of accuracy-bits-32|64 and
//              max-error should be specified for each function.  Otherwise,
//              the behavior is undefined.
//
//          domain-exclusion
//              This attribute specifies what special input values, if any,
//              may be ignored in the implementation of the math function.
//              (That is, it species the input values for which the
//              implementation may give garbage results.)  The value is
//              specified as an integer, which is interpreted as a bit mask.
//              The individual bits in the mask mean the following:
//                  0x1:  extreme values (defined on a per function basic)
//                  0x2:  NaNs
//                  0x4:  infinities
//                  0x8:  denormals
//                  0x10: zeros
//
// 'h': The operand is a void* that specifies the memory handle for an
//      intrinsic call.  This operand type is only valid when creating an
//      intrinsic function.  The specified handle is applied to any memory
//      references that get created as part of the intrinsic expansion.  If the
//      intrinsic expands to multiple memory references, they will all get this
//      same handle (which might not be as precise as you would like).  The
//      handle is an opaque type that is passed back to the client in the
//      disambiguation callback routine, CGGetProbabilityOfOverlapFromClient.
//
// There are several IL creation routines.  CGCreateNewInst creates and returns
// a new instruction.  CGAllocateInst allocates and returns a new instruction

//
// fp_contract                                   boolean        true
//     Enable or disable floating-point contractions, typically fused

//     enabled, the code generator may combine separate multiply and add
//     instructions into a single FMA instruction with no intermediate
//     rounding.  This transformation makes the result more accurate, but since
//     the compiler might or might not choose to make the transformation, the
//     result is less predictable.
//
// fenv_access                                   boolean        false
//     Enable or disable floating-point environment access.  When fenv_access
//     is disabled, the code generator may assume the default floating-point
//     environment, which typically means that all FP exceptions are masked and
//     that the rounding mode is round-to-nearest.  It also means the code
//     generator may assume that the program does not read the status bits.
//     From a practical perspective, this means the code generator can perform
//     optimizations like dead code elimination, constant folding, and various
//     forms of redundancy elimination.  When fenv_access is enabled, the code
//     generator is careful to honor the floating-point environment settings
//     and to preserve the status bit settings implied by the code.
//
// complex_limited_range                         boolean        false
//     Enable or disable complex_limited_range.  The standard mathematical
//     expressions for complex arithmetic can overflow or underflow when
//     evaluated using a floating-point representation with finite precision
//     and range, even when the result is within representable range.  When
//     complex_limited_range is enabled, the code generator may evaluate
//     complex arithmetic using the standard mathematical expressions.  When it
//     is disabled, the code generator will be careful to use calculations that
//     preserve the full range.  The code to do so might be slower than the
//     code generated under complex_limited_range.
//
// flush_to_zero                                 boolean        true
//     Enable or disable flush to zero (FTZ) and denormals are zero (DAZ)
//     modes.  When flush_to_zero is enabled, the code generator may generate
//     code that flushes denormal results to zero or treats denormal inputs as
//     zero.  Regardless of whether flush_to_zero mode is enabled or disabled,
//     the code generator is never required to flush denormal results to zero
//     or to treat denormal inputs as zero.
//
// fp_exception_semantics                        boolean        false
//     Enable or disable precise floating-point exceptions.  When
//     fp_exception_semantics is true, the code generator will produce code
//     that preserves all exceptions implied by the input code.  It will also
//     ensure that any exception is raised at the point in the program where
//     the exception occurred.  Practically speaking, this means that the code
//     generator will emit an fwait instruction after any x87 instruction that
//     might raise an exception.
//
// prec_div                                      boolean        false
//     Enable or disable precise floating-point division.  When prec_div is
//     true, the code generator will generate code that gives IEEE compliant
//     results for floating-point division.  When prec_div is false, the
//     code generator may use faster but less accurate divide implementations.
//     It might also evaluate A / B as A * (1 / B) or vice versa.
//
// prec_sqrt                                     boolean        false
//     Enable or disable precise floating-point square root.  When prec_sqrt is
//     true, the code generator will generate code that gives IEEE compliant
//     results for floating-point sqrt.  When prec_sqrt is false, the code
//     generator may use faster but less accurate sqrt implementations.
//
// fp_speculation                                boolean        true
//     Enable or disable floating-point speculation.  When fp_speculation is
//     true, the compiler might move a floating-point expression such that the
//     generated code evaluates the expression in cases where the original
//     program did not.  This can be useful for performance, e.g. by hoisting
//     a loop invariant expression out of a loop, but it can also raise
//     spurious exceptions.  It can be useful to disable fp_speculation in
//     programs that unmask exceptions the programmer wants to consider as
//     errors (e.g. invalid and divide-by-zero) but that otherwise do not
//     access the floating-point environment.
//
// pic                                           boolean        false
//     When "true", causes symbol references to be position independent.  This
//     means that PCG will use IP-relative addressing when accessing symbols
//     whose locations are known relative to the generated code.  (PCG assumes
//     that relative symbols addresses are known unless the callback function

//
// eliminate_frame_pointer                       boolean        true
//     When "true", PCG will attempt to eliminate the frame pointer and use

//     choose to disable this optimization if they rely on EBP/RBP chaining

// callback_name: "CGGetProbabilityOfOverlapFromClient"
// Description: CGGetProbabilityOfOverlapFromClient requests that the client
//      provide disambiguation information about the memory references
//      identified by handle1 and handle2.  (handle1 and handle2 are the
//      handles that were passed to CGCreateNewInst for 'm' operands.)
//      The client must return an integer in the range [0, 100].  A return
//      value of 0 is a guarantee from the client that the memory references
//      do not overlap.  A return value of 100 is a guarantee from the client
//      that the memory references do overlap.  Any other value is the client's
//      best guess for the probability that the memory references overlap.
// Default behavior: If the client does not provide a
//     CGGetProbabilityOfOverlapFromClient callback routine, the code generator
//     will issue a fatal diagnostic if it ever needs to make this callback.
//     All clients are encouraged to implement

// callback_name: "CGAddRelocationToClient"
// Description: CGAddRelocationToClient passes relocation information back to
//      the client.  This routine is called as many times as necessary during
//      the call to CGCompileRoutine.  The client_routine_handle identifies
//      the routine for the client.  It is the same handle that was passed to
//      PCG in the call to CGCreateRoutine.  code_offset gives the location in
//      the code at which to apply the relocation action.  It is an offset
//      from the start of the function.  symbol gives the CGSymbol to which
//      the relocation must be made.  relocation_type gives the type of
//      relocation.  addend specifies a constant addend used to compute the
//      value to be stored in the relocatable field.
// Default behavior: If the client does not provide a CGAddRelocationToClient
//     callback routine, the code generator will issue a fatal diagnostic if
//     it ever needs to make this callback.  All clients are encouraged to
//     implement CGAddRelocationToClient.

// callback_name: "CGDiagnosticMessage"
// Description: PCG calls CGDiagnosticMessage to pass diagnostic information
//     back to the client.  This can be for user-level errors, warnings, and
//     remarks or for internal errors, which are typically assertion failures.
//     PCG provides the diagnostic severity, source position information
//     (file, line, col), and a descriptive error message.  For fatal errors
//     and internal errors, after the client returns from CGDiagnosticMessage,
//     PCG will raise an exception by calling longjmp if the client has set a
//     setjmp context using CGSetSetjmpContext.  Otherwise, it will exit.
// Default behavior: If the client does not provide a CGDiagnosticMessage
//     callback routine, then when a diagnostic needs to be generated, PCG will
//     print a message of its own choosing to stderr.
//
CGDeclareCallback(void, CGDiagnosticMessage,

//
// callback_name: "CGSetBinarySourcePosition"
// Description: PCG invokes this callback to tell the client that the
//     instruction at offset "code_offset" from the start of the routine is
//     associated with the specified source position.
//     PCG invokes this routine in ascending "code_offset" order for every
//     change in source position.
//
// Default behavior: If the client does not provide a CGSetBinarySourcePosition
//     callback routine, then no source position information emitted
//     for client. Assembler path is not affected whether it registered or not.
//     If the callback is registered PCG emits source position information
//     regardless whether it was set to valid source position or not.
//     That means that client should expect NULL value for source position.
//

//
// callback_name: "CGGetSourcePosition"
// Description: PCG invokes this callback to translate non-null CGSrcPosHandle
//     source position data into source file, line number and column number
//     representation. File name is provided as return value while the other
//     two via pointer arguments.
//
// Default behavior: If the client does not provide a CGGetSourcePosition
//     callback routine but sets valid (non-null) source position information
//     using CGSetSourcePosition interface routine then attempt to get source
//     file name, or line number, or column number for that source position
//     results in diagnostics error message. PCG normally does not call the
//     callback with NULL source position.

                                int32_t *col));
//
// callback_name: "CGGetMemConstSymbolForRoutineFromClient"
// Description: CGGetMemConstSymbolForRoutineFromClient requests that the
//     client allocate memory to hold a constant value and then create a
//     CGSymbol that the code generator can use to reference that memory.
//     The memory must be at least "length" bytes and have at least "align"
//     alignment.  The client must copy the first "length" bytes from "value"
//     to the newly allocated memory.
//
// Default behavior: If the client does not provide a
//     CGGetMemConstSymbolForRoutineFromClient callback routine, the code
//     generator will issue a fatal diagnostic if it ever needs to make this
//     callback.  All clients are encouraged to implement
//     CGGetMemConstSymbolForRoutineFromClient.
